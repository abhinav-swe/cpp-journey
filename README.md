# cpp-journey
Welcome to my **C++ Journey Repository!**  
I’m currently a **B.Tech CSE student** with a passion for **AI & Machine Learning** 🤖.  
This repository documents my complete learning path from **C++ fundamentals** to **DSA** and **project building** — step by step.

## 🧠 About This Repository

This repo is my **learning companion** — it includes:
- 📘 Well-structured code examples
- 🧾 Notes and explanations in Markdown
- 🧩 Practice problems and mini projects
- 🧮 Upcoming DSA and OOP concepts

The goal is to **master C++ as my first programming language** and build a solid foundation for advanced AI/ML development later.
